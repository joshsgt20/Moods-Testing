    <p>Further than this, you can use 'grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));. This would make each grid take up 300px, until it's not available anymore, so it changes to 1fr.
        It is essentially flex-wrap.</p>
    <section id="gallery">
    
        <div class="box7">Box 7</div>
        
        <div class="box8">Box 8</div>
        
        <div class="box9">Box 9</div>
        
        </section>


    
<p>Can either use first method, where you define the amount of columns/rows and select each
    div using 'grid-column-start'. Here you would start from the lines - so a grid with 2 columns has 3 lines.<br>
    To define it, use 'grid-column-start' and 'grid-column-end'. Or, can <strong>simplify to just 'grid-column 1/3</strong>.<br>
    Can do the exact same for rows, using 'grid-row'. <br>
    To simplify code, can use 'grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20%)'. You can write 'grid-template-columns: repeat(autofit (or-autofill), 400px) to make it responsive (like flex-wrap)'<br>

    <strong>Sometimes you must combine both columns and rows as the page will automatically lay them out in the wrong way.</strong>
    <br>Can add 'grid-column-gap' and to rows to space things out.
</p>
<br>
 <section id="template">

    <div class="box1">Box 1</div>

    <div class="box2">Box 2</div>

    <div class="box3">Box 3</div>

 </section>

<br>

<p>The other (easier) method is using 'grid-area: name' where the name can be anything you want.
<br>Here, once you have named each box with 'grid-area', you show it in the section itself, using 'grid-template-areas'.<br>
<strong>You define each row by using quotes " " and write each name of the box for where it needs to be.</strong> To stretch a box, just 
write its name multiple times. For an empty space, just use a fullstop .
Can use 'justify-items' and 'align-items' when in the section to show where the item will be in its grid.<br>
To effect just one specific grid, use 'align-self' for that specific division.<br>
<strong>Can define each grid as a flex-container, and go on to edit them from there.</strong></p>
