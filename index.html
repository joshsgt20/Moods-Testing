    <h1>Welcome to Moods. Testing</h1>
    <p>This is a collection of different work that I've created over the last couple of months. This work comes 
        from my own knowledge, as well as following different tutorials and courses I've signed up for to have better skills 
        with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

        features that will be included on the Moods. site.</strong>

    <p>There are other parts of the Moods. app that I am yet to create, such as the Mediation app or music app, but these will be completed and added to this page over time.
        For now, I just wanted to get a bit ahead for CW2 and try and improve my coding skills.
